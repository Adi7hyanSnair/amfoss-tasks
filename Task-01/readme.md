# TERMINAL WIZARD

Before I started doing the tasks i went through the instructions given in tyhe amfoss Praveshan PDF,
I watched several YouTube channels to study the functioning of the linux Commands
and started doing the tasks.
The commands Include - cd, ls, git clone, git branches -a, cd .., ....etc.

# 1. Enter The Maze
To enter the maze I cloned the git hub provided in the Task. I also authorised git hub 
using the linux Terminal. I found it difficult to push the codes to git hub. I am confused in pushing the codes.
For the time being I will add the Screen Shots of the terminal In which i found the spell 
and where i got the code.
I will surely Figure it out when I reach the campus after the onam holidays.
After Entered the maze by cloning the GitHub provided I started doing The challenges

# 2. First Challenge
I read the instructions given in the amfoss Preveshan pdf and figures about '0x' and '0y'.
I started the challenge by opening the cloned github TerminalWizard using the linux command
cd TerminalWizard the further opened by ls command.
Then i figured out what 'x' and 'y' is.
It was given that 'x' is the first perfect number therefore i figured that x=6 i.e , 6=1+2+3
hence 6 is the first perfect number.
It was given that 'y' is the number you get by differentiating (xÂ²-7x) with respect to 'x'.
Then I figured out 'y' i.e, I got y=5.
After running all the Linux Command accordingly I got the spell Impedimenta.
Then I run the python file Impedimenta.py file from spellbook using Linux Command.
I am also Attaching the Linux Terminal Screen Shot.

# 3. Second Challenge
I read the instructions given in the amfoss Praveshan PDF and figured out the '0x' and '0y' in this task.
In this task 'x' is the unit place of the atomic number of element which 
is first used to make semicundoctors. And 'y' is the 10s place of the atomic
number of the element Which is first used for making the semicunductor.
I found which element was first used for making the semicunductor.
It was germanium which has atomic number 32. I searched it in google to be honest.
So i figured out 'x' is 2 and 'y' is 3.
Hence after done after the Linux Commands I got the spell Stupefy.
Then I ran the Python file Stupefy.py which I got from the spellbook.
After running The python file i got the secret code.
I am also attaching the Linux Terminal Screen Shot.

# 4. Third Challenge
In this task First I found the Branch which has been taught by Prof.Lupin Hogwarts.
When I found I recall The branch from the movie , defenseAgainsTheDarkArts.
Then I found Out the Shape Shifting Creature from the Riddle , it was Boggart.
I found that using ChatGPT. After that I figured out the spell used against Boggart was 
Riddikulus. To get the Riddikulus Python File I need to Checkout the github branch Using 
git checkout linux Terminal Command.
After that I ran the Python file Riddikulus.py and I got the secret code.
I am Attaching the Linux Terminal Screen Shot.

# 5. Fourth Challenge
For this Challenge I went through the amfoss praveshan PDF. And I figured out that the clue for this challenge
is in the commit logs of the repository. The spell clue was where x is the number of horcruxes made by Voldemort 
and y is the number that has same alphabets as the number. 
From this clue I figured Out 'x' = 7. I got searched it from Google.
And I figured 'y' = 4 using the clue i.e , no: of alphabets in Seven is
Four (S,e,v,n).Using the needed Linux Command I got the Spell that is Priori Incantatem.
Then I got the python file after checkout the graveyard GitHub Branch.
Then after running the python file I got the Fourth code.
I am attaching the Linux Terminal Screen Shot.

# 6. The End
After Fiding All The four code from the Challenges above . I went through the Aamfoss Praveshan PDF again and 
I started to find the final Spell.
I used The Linux Terminal Command echo <string> | base64 --decode for decoding the four the code which 
i got from the above challenges.
After decoding I got A http://GitHub.com  link which further I cloned to get the Final Spell Txt file.
After opening the github file I opened the file using ls Linux Terminal Command and I got A python 
file from There.
Then I ran that Python File to get The final Output.
And I completed the first Task.
I am Attaching The Linux Terminal Command Screen Shots.

# Conclusion
It was a great journey Finding the spells and doing the linux Terminal Command.
I enjoyed the Terminal Wizard Competition.


It really felt like The competition In the Herry Potter Fiction.
It was very Fun doing The Task
