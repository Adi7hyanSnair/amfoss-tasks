# TERMINAL WIZARD

Before I started doing the tasks i went through the instructions given in tyhe amfoss Praveshan PDF,
I watched several YouTube channels to study the functioning of the linux Commands
and started doing the tasks.
The commands Include - cd, ls, git clone, git branches -a, cd .., ....etc.

# 1. Enter The Maze
To enter the maze I cloned the git hub provided in the Task. I also authorised git hub 
using the linux Terminal. I found it difficult to push the codes to git hub. I am confused in pushing the codes.
For the time being I will add the Screen Shots of the terminal In which i found the spell 
and where i got the code.
I will surely Figure it out when I reach the campus after the onam holidays.
After Entered the maze by cloning the GitHub provided I started doing The challenges

# 2. First Challenge
I read the instructions given in the amfoss Preveshan pdf and figures about '0x' and '0y'.
I started the challenge by opening the cloned github TerminalWizard using the linux command
cd TerminalWizard the further opened by ls command.
Then i figured out what 'x' and 'y' is.
It was given that 'x' is the first perfect number therefore i figured that x=6 i.e , 6=1+2+3
hence 6 is the first perfect number.
It was given that 'y' is the number you get by differentiating (xÂ²-7x) with respect to 'x'.
Then I figured out 'y' i.e, I got y=5.
After running all the Linux Command accordingly I got the spell Impedimenta.
Then I run the python file Impedimenta.py file from spellbook using Linux Command.
I am also Attaching the Linux Terminal Screen Shot.

# 3. Second Challenge
I read the instructions given in the amfoss Praveshan PDF and figured out the '0x' and '0y' in this task.
In this task 'x' is the unit place of the atomic number of element which 
is first used to make semicundoctors. And 'y' is the 10s place of the atomic
number of the element Which is first used for making the semicunductor.
I found which element was first used for making the semicunductor.
It was germanium which has atomic number 32. I searched it in google to be honest.
So i figured out 'x' is 2 and 'y' is 3.
Hence after done after the Linux Commands I got the spell Stupefy.
Then I ran the Python file Stupefy.py which I got from the spellbook.
After running The python file i got the secret code.
I am also attaching the Linux Terminal Screen Shot.

# 4. Third Challenge
In this task First I found the Branch which has been taught by Prof.Lupin Hogwarts.
When I found I recall The branch from the movie , defenseAgainsTheDarkArts.
Then I found Out the Shape Shifting Creature from the Riddle , it was Boggart.
I found that using ChatGPT. After that I figured out the spell used against Boggart was 
Riddikulus. To get the Riddikulus Python File I need to Checkout the github branch Using 
git checkout linux Terminal Command.
After that I ran the Python file Riddikulus.py and I got the secret code.
I am Attaching the Linux Terminal Screen Shot.
