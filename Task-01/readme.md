# TERMINAL WIZARD

Before I started doing the tasks i went through the instructions given in tyhe amfoss Praveshan PDF,
I watched several YouTube channels to study the functioning of the linux Commands
and started doing the tasks.
The commands Include - cd, ls, git clone, git branches -a, cd .., ....etc.

# 1. Enter The Maze
To enter the maze I cloned the git hub provided in the Task. I also authorised git hub 
using the linux Terminal. I found it difficult to push the codes to git hub. I am confused in pushing the codes.
For the time being I will add the Screen Shots of the terminal In which i found the spell 
and where i got the code.
I will surely Figure it out when I reach the campus after the onam holidays.
After Entered the maze by cloning the GitHub provided I started doing The challenges

# 2. First Challenge
I read the instructions given in the amfoss Preveshan pdf and figures about '0x' and '0y'.
I started the challenge by opening the cloned github TerminalWizard using the linux command
cd TerminalWizard the further opened by ls command.
Then i figured out what 'x' and 'y' is.
It was given that 'x' is the first perfect number therefore i figured that x=6 i.e , 6=1+2+3
hence 6 is the first perfect number.
It was given that 'y' is the number you get by differentiating (xÂ²-7x) with respect to 'x'.
Then I figured out 'y' i.e, I got y=5.
After running all the Linux Command accordingly I got the spell Impedimenta.
Then I run the python file Impedimenta.py file from spellbook using Linux Command.
I am also Attaching the Linux Termina Screen Shot.
