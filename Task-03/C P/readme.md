The isPrime function checks if a given number num is prime. It returns 1 if num is prime and 0 otherwise.

In the main function, we prompt the user to enter a number n using printf and read the input with scanf.

We check if n is less than 2. If n is less than 2, we print a message indicating that prime numbers start from 2.

If n is greater than or equal to 2, we print "Prime numbers up to n" and then iterate through numbers from 2 to n. 
For each number, we call the isPrime function to check if it's prime. If it's prime, we print the number to the terminal.
