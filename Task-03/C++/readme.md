# C++

The isPrime function checks if a given number num is prime.
It returns true if num is prime and false otherwise.

In the main function, we use cout to prompt the user to enter a number n and cin to read the input.

We check if n is less than 2. If n is less than 2, we use cout to print a message indicating that prime numbers start from 2.

If n is greater than or equal to 2, we use cout to print "Prime numbers up to n" and then iterate through numbers from 2 to n. 
For each number, we call the isPrime function to check if it's prime. If it's prime, we use cout to print the number to the terminal.
