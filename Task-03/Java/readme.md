# Java

isPrime(num) method: This method takes an integer num and checks whether it is prime.
It returns true if num is prime and false otherwise. It uses a simple method to check for divisibility by numbers from 2 to the square root of num.

In the main method, we use a Scanner to get user input for the number n.

We check if n is less than 2, and if so, we print a message indicating that prime numbers start from 2.

If n is greater than or equal to 2, we iterate through numbers from 2 to n and use the isPrime method to 
determine if each number is prime. If it is, we print the prime number to the terminal.

The program then prints the prime numbers up to n to the terminal.
